# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Greetings, feel free to call me Calvin. I am a dedicated team player who is inquisitive, likes to keep a firm schedule, and mostly goes by the books with some flexibility if necessary. I recently graduated from the Computer Programmer Analyst program at George Brown College with an Ontario College Advanced Diploma and a GPA of 3.83/4. Although most of my knowledge of the tech/IT industry comes from my time at Jarvis and my educational background at George Brown, I have gained other skills outside of this field. My ability to communicate and act as a team player established itself throughout my time as a bartender/server. I worked in a rough fast-paced environment that required me to be on my toes, give the best possible service to customers, and work within a tight-knit team. I'm a fan of hockey and ice skating. I am also quite a hobbyist with hobbies such as brewing beer, where I experiment with recipes to get the best possible batch, which is why I also like tech because I constantly learn, test, and create software. Overall, I'm hoping for an opportunity in the software development industry where I can prove myself as a team member.
