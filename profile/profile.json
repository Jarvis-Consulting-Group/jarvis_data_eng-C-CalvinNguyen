The project uses the MEAN stack that includes technologies such as MongoDB that stores account information once an account is registered. The front-end/client-side mobile application uses Angular/(Ionic); it can read local audio files, stores their metadata into an SQLite local storage, play these files, and connect to the backend server once authenticated. The NodeJS backend server allows users to create accounts, upload audio files onto the server, and stream it back to the user.",

The other Bash scripts (hardware_info.sh and hardware_usage.sh) collect and store the data from the machine using Linux commands like lscpu, vmstat, and psql. Finally, crontab jobs schedule the script's execution every minute.",

  "summary": "Greetings, feel free to call me Calvin. I am a dedicated team player who is inquisitive, likes to keep a firm schedule, and mostly goes by the books with some flexibility if necessary. I recently graduated from the Computer Programmer Analyst program at George Brown College with an Ontario College Advanced Diploma and a GPA of 3.83/4. Although most of my knowledge of the tech/IT industry comes from my time at Jarvis and my educational background at George Brown, I have gained other skills outside of this field. My ability to communicate and act as a team player established itself throughout my time as a bartender/server. I worked in a rough fast-paced environment that required me to be on my toes, give the best possible service to customers, and work within a tight-knit team. I'm a fan of hockey and ice skating. I am also quite a hobbyist with hobbies such as brewing beer, where I experiment with recipes to get the best possible batch, which is why I also like tech because I constantly learn, test, and create software. Overall, I'm hoping for an opportunity in the software development industry where I can prove myself as a team member."
