  "summary": "I am a dedicated team player who is inquisitive, punctual, and goes by the book. I recently graduated with an Ontario College Advanced Diploma from the Computer Programming \u0026 Analysis program at George Brown College. During my time at George Brown, I've learned technologies such as React, Node.js, Angular, MongoDB, Spring, and ASP.NET by building projects like a front-end application that connects to an open-source weather API or full-stack applications where we built both the front and backend while following the Agile project management methodology. I've also gained other skills outside George Brown that are crucial to a workplace. My ability to communicate and act as a team player established itself throughout my time as a bartender/server. I worked in a rough fast-paced environment that required me to be on my toes, give the best possible service to customers, and work within a tight-knit team. I am quite a hobbyist with hobbies such as brewing beer, where I experiment with recipes to get the best possible batch, which is why I also like tech because I constantly learn, test, and create software. Overall, I'm hoping for an opportunity in the software development industry where I can prove myself as a team member."
