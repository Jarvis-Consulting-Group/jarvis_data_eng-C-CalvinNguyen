# Introduction

The SQL Project allows us to familiarize ourselves with concepts surrounding relational databases. These concepts are 
relational database management systems, structured query language, SQL optimization techniques, and data modeling. 
We also had a variety of tasks, answering questions about the concepts relating to SQL and implementing queries on 
existing data provided to us. To work on implementing queries, we had to use a variety of tools such as Git for 
managing the code history of SQL files, a Docker container running our PostgreSQL database, installing pgAdmin; 
an integrated development environment specifically for PostgreSQL, and lastly, we inserted the existing data file
(clubdata.sql) into the database using the command pql -h localhost -U postgres -f clubdata.sql -d postgres -x -q.

# SQL Queries

###### Table Setup (DDL)

Following the provided entity-relational data model, there are three tables we must implement. The cd.facilities tables 
with a primary key of facid (facility id), the cd.members table with a primary key of memid (member id) and foreign 
key of recommendedby which points back to the memid of the cd.members table, and lastly a joining table between 
cd.facilities and cd.members called cd.bookings with foreign keys facid referencing facid from cd.facilities 
(this is also the primary key), and memid referencing memid in cd.members.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cd.facilities (
    "facid" integer NOT NULL,
    "name" character varying(100),
    "membercost" numeric,
    "guestcost" numeric,
    "initialoutlay" numeric,
    "monthlymaintenance" numeric,
    CONSTRAINT "PK_facid" PRIMARY KEY ("facid")
);

CREATE TABLE cd.members (
    "memid" integer NOT NULL,
    "surname" character varying(200) NOT NULL,
    "firstname" character varying(200) NOT NULL,
    "address" character varying(300) NOT NULL,
    "zipcode" integer NOT NULL,
    "telephone" character varying(20) NOT NULL,
    "recommendedby" integer,
    "joindate" timestamp NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "PK_memid" PRIMARY KEY ("memid"),
    CONSTRAINT "FK_recommendby" FOREIGN KEY ("recommendedby")
        REFERENCES public.members ("memid") ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE cd.bookings (
    "facid" integer NOT NULL,
    "memid" integer NOT NULL,
    "starttime" timestamp NOT NULL,
    "slots" integer NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_bookings_facid" PRIMARY KEY ("facid"),
    CONSTRAINT "fk_facilities_facid" FOREIGN KEY ("facid")
        REFERENCES public.facilities ("facid"),
    CONSTRAINT "fk_members_memid" FOREIGN KEY ("memid")
        REFERENCES public.members ("memid")
);
```

###### Question 1: Insert a new facility into the facilities table.

- Inserted a new record into the cd.facilities table with the given values. (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800)

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,
    initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
)
VALUES
    (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```

###### Question 2: Insert the Spa facility again but automatically get the next facility ID.

- Automatically generated the facility ID using a sub-query that counts all the records. Since the IDs are
zero-based, the count will return the subsequent number.

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost,
    initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
)
VALUES
    (
        SELECT
        COUNT(*)
        FROM
        cd.facilities,
        'Spa',
        20,
        30,
        100000,
        800
    );
```

###### Question 3: Update the initial outlay for the second tennis court to 10000.

- Used the UPDATE statement to change the initial outlay value for the second tennis court. The conditions for 
the WHERE clause are to specify which record was initial outlay = 80000 and pattern matching with '%Tennis Court%'.

```sql
UPDATE
    cd.facilities
SET
    initialoutlay = 10000
WHERE
    name like '%Tennis Court%'
    AND initialoutlay = 8000;
```

###### Question 4: Update the costs for the second tennis court so that it is 10% more than the first tennis court.

- Used the UPDATE statement to change the member cost and guest cost fields for the second tennis court. 
We used sub-queries to get the first tennis court's cost values and multiplied by 1.1 (to get 10% more).

```sql
UPDATE
    cd.facilities
SET
    membercost = (
        SELECT
            membercost * 1.1
        FROM
            cd.facilities
        WHERE
            name = 'Tennis Court 1'
    ),
    guestcost = (
        SELECT
            guestcost * 1.1
        FROM
            cd.facilities
        WHERE
            name = 'Tennis Court 1'
    )
WHERE
    name like 'Tennis Court 2';
```

###### Question 5: Delete all the records within the bookings table.

- Used a DELETE statement without a WHERE clause to delete all the records.

```sql
DELETE FROM
    cd.bookings;
```

###### Question 6: Delete a member from the cd.members table.

- Used a DELETE statement to remove the record with member ID 37 by using a WHERE clause.

```sql
DELETE FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    memid = 37;
```

###### Question 7: Select records that charges members fees and the fee is 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost.

- Used a SELECT statement to retrieve records where the member cost was above 0 (a fee exists), and a
calculation where that member cost was less than the monthly maintenance divided by 50.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    name,
    membercost,
    monthlymaintenance
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    membercost > 0
    and membercost < (monthlymaintenance / 50);
```

###### Question 8: Retrieve all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name.

- Used a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause which utilizes pattern matching to 
find names with the word 'Tennis' ('%Tennis%').

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    name LIKE '%Tennis%';
```

###### Question 9: Retrieve the records with the member IDs of 1 and 5 without using the OR operator.

- Used a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that has an IN operator. The IN operator matches values by the list
inside the parentheses.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    cd.facilities
WHERE
    facid IN(1, 5);
```

###### Question 10: Get a list of records of members who joined on and after September 2012.

- Used a SELECT statement and WHERE clause where the join date was equal to or greater than September 1st, 2012.

```sql
SELECT
    memid,
    surname,
    firstname,
    joindate
FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    joindate >= '2012-09-01';
```

###### Question 11: Use a UNION operator to combine two statements.

- Used a UNION operator to combine two SELECT statements. The SELECT statements returned the surname of members and 
facility names from facilities. The UNION operator combines the two since both SELECT statements return one column 
of character-varying data type.

```sql
SELECT
    surname
FROM
    cd.members
UNION
SELECT
    name
FROM
    cd.facilities;
```

###### Question 12: Retrieve all start times from bookings for the member 'David Farrell'

- Used a SELECT statement that JOINs the tables bookings with the table members on the member ID. A WHERE clause was
also included returning matching rows where the member's first name is 'David' and surname is 'Farrell'.

```sql
SELECT
    boo.starttime
FROM
    cd.bookings AS boo
    JOIN cd.members AS mem ON boo.memid = mem.memid
WHERE
    mem.firstname = 'David'
    AND mem.surname = 'Farrell';
```

###### Question 13: Retrieve records of start times for the tennis court facilities on September 21st, 2012.

- Used a SELECT statement that JOINs the bookings and facilities table with a WHERE clause for facility names like
'%Tennis Court%' and timestamps on September 21st, 2012 (timestamp >= '2012-09-21' AND timestamp < '2012-09-22').

```sql
SELECT
    boo.starttime,
    fac.name
FROM
    cd.bookings AS boo
    JOIN cd.facilities AS fac ON boo.facid = fac.facid
WHERE
    fac.name LIKE '%Tennis Court%'
    AND boo.starttime >= '2012-09-21'
    AND boo.starttime < '2012-09-22';
```

###### Question 14: Use self-join to retrieve the name of members and their recommender.

- Used a SELECT statement that JOINs to itself (self-join using aliases). 
The table then returns the member's name and the names of their recommender (recommended by ID).

```sql
SELECT
    mem.firstname AS memfname,
    mem.surname AS memsname,
    rec.firstname AS recfname,
    rec.surname AS recsname
FROM
    cd.members AS mem
    LEFT OUTER JOIN cd.members as rec ON rec.memid = mem.recommendedby
ORDER BY
    memsname,
    memfname;
```

###### Question 15: Retrieve the names of all members who have recommended someone.

- Used a SELECT statement that joins the table to itself (self-join using aliases). We then return
unique values just in case someone has recommended more than one member.

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT rec.firstname AS recfname,
    rec.surname AS recsname
FROM
    cd.members AS mem
    JOIN cd.members as rec ON rec.memid = mem.recommendedby
ORDER BY
    recsname,
    recfname;
```

###### Question 16: Retrieve the names of members and their recommenders without using JOIN keyword.

- Used a SELECT statement with a sub-query to retrieve the recommender's name and ordered it by the first column.

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT (firstname || ' ' || surname) AS member,
    (
     SELECT
         (firstname || ' ' || surname)
     FROM
         cd.members AS mem2
     WHERE
         mem1.recommendedby = mem2.memid
    ) AS recommender
FROM
    cd.members AS mem1
ORDER BY
    1;
```

###### Question 17: Count the number of recommendations by member.

- Used the COUNT aggregate function to retrieve the number of times a member has recommended someone. 
The result is grouped and ordered by the column 'recommendedby'.

```sql
SELECT
    recommendedby,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    recommendedby IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    recommendedby
ORDER BY
    recommendedby;
```

###### Question 18: Retrieve the SUM of slots by facility.

- Used the SUM aggregate function grouped by facility ID to retrieve the sum of slots. 
The results are then ordered by facility ID.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM
    cd.bookings
GROUP BY
    facid
ORDER BY
    facid;
```

###### Question 19: Retrieve the SUM of slots by facility during the month of September 2012.

- Used the SUM aggregate function grouped by facility ID with a WHERE clause for records during September 2012
to retrieve the sum of slots for that month. The result is in ascending order by the aggregate column.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM
    cd.bookings
WHERE
    starttime >= '2012-09-01'
    AND starttime < '2012-10-01'
GROUP BY
    facid
ORDER BY
    2;
```

###### Question 20: Use multiple group bys to retrieve the sum of slots for facilities during each month.

- Used the SUM aggregate function grouped by facility ID and month
number (A digit from the timestamp is retrieved using EXTRACT() function) where the year was 2012.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    EXTRACT(
            'MONTH'
            FROM
            starttime
        ) AS month,
    SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM
    cd.bookings
WHERE
    starttime >= '2012-01-01'
    AND starttime <= '2012-12-31'
GROUP BY
    facid,
    2
ORDER BY
    1,
    2;
```

###### Question 21: Find the number of members who have made at least one booking.

- Used the COUNT aggregate function with the DISTINCT keyword to retrieve the number of unique member ID values in bookings.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT memid)
FROM
    cd.bookings;
```

###### Question 22: Retrieve members who had their first booking after September 1st, 2012.

- Used the MIN aggregate function to find the first booking date of members on or after September 1st, 2012. 
Retrieved the name fields from the member's table through a join.

```sql
SELECT
    mem.surname,
    mem.firstname,
    boo.memid,
    MIN(boo.starttime)
FROM
    cd.bookings AS boo
    JOIN cd.members AS mem ON mem.memid = boo.memid
WHERE
    boo.starttime >= '2012-09-01'
GROUP BY
    mem.surname,
    mem.firstname,
    boo.memid
ORDER BY
    boo.memid;
```

###### Question 23: Retrieve all member names and a column containing the total number of members.

- Used the COUNT window function with OVER, so the total number of members is printed on all rows
as it treats all rows as one group.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(memid) OVER(),
    firstname,
    surname
FROM
    cd.members
ORDER BY
    joindate;
```

###### Question 24: Retrieve all member names and the row number as a field.

- Used the ROW_NUMBER window function with the OVER option so the query prints the row number on all rows.

```sql
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(),
    firstname,
    surname
FROM
    cd.members
ORDER BY
    joindate;
```

###### Question 25: Retrieve the highest SUM of slots by facility (if there is a tie print both).

- Used a sub-query to rank the sum of slots and retrieve any rows ranked 1st.

```sql
SELECT
    facid,
    total
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            facid,
            sum(slots) AS total,
            rank() over (
        ORDER BY
          SUM(slots) DESC
      ) AS rank
        FROM
            cd.bookings
        GROUP BY
            facid
    ) AS ranked
WHERE
    rank = 1;
```

###### Question 26: Combine and format the surname and first name fields of members.

- Combined surname and first name with string concatenation using the || operator.

```sql
SELECT
    surname || ', ' || firstname AS name
FROM
    cd.members;
```

###### Question 27: Retrieve all records with telephone numbers that have parentheses.

- Used pattern matching in the WHERE clause to find strings telephone numbers with parentheses '%(___)%'
(3 values within the parentheses).

```sql
SELECT
    memid,
    telephone
FROM
    cd.members
WHERE
    telephone LIKE '%(___)%';
```

###### Question 28: Count the number of members by the first letter of their surname.

- Used a substring function to retrieve the first letter of a member's surname, 
a COUNT aggregate function, and group by the first column.

```sql
SELECT
    SUBSTR(surname, 1, 1),
    count(*)
FROM
    cd.members
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    1;
```
